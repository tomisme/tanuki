 - Clojurescript App using shadow-cljs
 - re-frame as a capability vat?
 - event handlers
   - shared peer-to-peer
   - stateless capabilities
 - how might we send live (but stateless) capabilities over the wire?

From 
> With capability security, object A can get access to object B only by:
> 
> (1) being born with it, when object A's creator already has that access;
> 
> (2) receiving it in a message (from an object that already has that access); or
> 
> (3) being the creator of object B.
